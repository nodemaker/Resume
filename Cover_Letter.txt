To whomever it may concern,

My name is Sumeru Chatterjee and I am an experienced iOS Developer. I have developed iOS Apps since the first releases of Apple iOS Frameworks (iOS 2.0).

I first started developing iOS Apps in late 2009 to help my friends startup and fell in love with the platform. Since then I have developed iOS apps for companies in the United States. Netherlands, UK and Singapore. I have also started my own company(LLC) and developed three apps under it. As of now I am working for Ebay as a contractor helping them deliver iOS apps in 10 different countries.

I also possess a strong engineering background with a Masters Degree in Computer science from the University of Florida. Having worked for some big companies in the US I have experience in creating a large scale engineering infrastructure and that is flexible and scalable. 

I am applying to you since your opportunity looks like a good fit for my skillset. Please take a look at my resume and reach out to me at sumeru.chatterjee@me.com or on phone at +31638146100 if you see a good fit too. Cheers!
